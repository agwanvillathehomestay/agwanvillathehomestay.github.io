                <p>Thanks for a lovely stay. We enjoyed the tranquil, serene environment and lovely ambience of the place. the place is done up very thoughtfully especially the gazebo, treehouse and the numerous artefacts. The caretaker - Singgari was really handy in taking care of our needs. My kids and pet absolutely loved the place especially the lovely lawn and treehouse.</p>

                <p>This property is truly a getaway from the routine drone of ur life. The interiors are a perfect combination of modern living meets 19th century England.
The porch and lawn are the quaintest place to hangout or take a stroll in.
oh and I couldn't say enough about their German shepherd that lives on the property. She'll totally adopt u for ur short stay and fill in blanks, u didn't know existed ;)</p>

              <div class="post-corporate-text">
                <p>There are not enough words to describe how amazing this place is. From the moment we entered the property, we were awestruck at how beautiful and well maintained it was.
                We could go on to describe how great each and every thing at the villa was, but that we shall leave for future guests to experience it for themselves and we certainly recommend this place to everyone visiting Jaipur.
                Although the place didn't have internet as part of the amenities, Radhika provided us with her personal network to remain connected through the trip. Not only that, she took it up personally to make sure that our stay remained comfortable visiting us and calling us to see how they can be of help almost daily.
                A definite mention on this trip would be the caretaker, Singari, who was ever available to make us feel at home, ensuring utmost comfort through and through. Any maintenance or help needed was attended to in the blink of an eye and this was all done by Singari.
                Last but definitely not the least, was their playful dog, which actually made this feel like a homestay and not just a hotel stay.
                Thank you Radhika, and Singari for making this trip truly memorable. You two are grades above just Superhosts.</p>

                <p>One of the best villa i have ever been to. Place was clean, beautiful and well maintained. Private jacuzzi with garden were definitely a plus point.

                <p>Radhika and Ajay's place is a great getaway bnb for a relaxed weekend in Jaipur. The place is easy to find and not that far away from a bunch of eateries should you decide to dine out or order in. The villa has personally designed handicrafts in every nook and corner and you will definitely marvel at the effort that the hosts have put into intricately designing & decorating the place. There are a few signs of wear here and there that probably require renovation but it's by and large maintained fine for a property this size. There is a caretaker available on the property throughout and she is a polite soft-spoken person. There is also a well trained and well behaved german shepherd on the property. Lastly Radhika & Ajay are accomodating hosts who have set up a lovely holiday home and you shouldn't think twice before booking it if a relaxed weekend getaway away from city life is what you are after.</p>

                <p>It was a amazing place . Just as in the pictures . We stayed there on our way to Jodhpur . Was travelling with my wife , two kids and a pet . It was more of a stopover for us for the night . But we all loved it . It was just off the highway . Kids had a lovely time in the Jacuzzi and they watched a movie on the big screen outdoors . A caretaker lady made us tea and breakfast and she is a wonderful host . Great place and very artistically made .</p>
